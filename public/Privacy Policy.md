Last Updated: June 2, 2025

Welcome to Aihara's Privacy Policy!
We are committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains how Aihara collects, uses, and manages data when you use the bot on Discord.

1. Data We Collect
Aihara may collect the following data:
- Public Discord Information: Profile pictures, banners, usernames, and user IDs that are publicly available when you use specific commands.
- Commands and Interactions: Data related to the commands you execute (e.g., requests to fetch images from APIs) and information such as server IDs, channel IDs, or timestamps.
- Data from External APIs: Images or other content fetched from third-party APIs based on your commands.

2. Purpose of Data Collection
Collected data is used to:
- Operate the bot's functions, such as displaying profile pictures, banners, or API-fetched images.
- Improve Aihara's performance and features.
- Detect and prevent abuse (e.g., spam or suspicious activity).

3. Data Storage and Security
- Data is stored only as long as necessary to operate the bot or as required by law.
- We do not store sensitive information such as passwords or non-public personal data.
- Data fetched from external APIs is displayed temporarily and not permanently stored by Aihara, except for temporary caching to improve performance.

4. Data Sharing
- Aihara does not share your personal data with third parties, except:
  - When required by law or to comply with Discord's regulations.
  - When data is fetched from third-party APIs you access via commands (in which case, the third-party API's privacy policy applies).
- Public data, such as profile pictures or banners, may be visible to other users in your Discord server when you use related commands.

5. Your Rights
- You can prevent Aihara from processing certain data by not using relevant commands (e.g., commands to display profile pictures).
- You can remove Aihara from your server at any time to stop data collection.
